# Changelog

## [0.1.1] "True Margin" — 2026-09-15

Fixes found by actually using v0.1.0:

- **The PDF reader showed "Reader" twice** — the shared reader window's own headerbar and
  the PDF reader's own inner headerbar both fell back to the window's title, which is now
  a fixed "Reader" shared across every open tab rather than per-document the way it used to
  be. The inner header now shows the actual document title instead of falling back.
- **Keyboard page/chapter navigation now actually works.** It was wired up in 0.1.0 but
  never fired in practice — a focused button, dropdown, or (for EPUB) the page content
  itself could consume Left/Right/Home/End before the shortcut ever saw them. Fixed by
  intercepting those keys ahead of that, while still leaving Left/Right/Home/End alone
  when the page-number or search field has focus, so typing there still moves the text
  cursor normally.
- **The Notes/annotations sidebar toggle moved to the right** of the header, next to
  Contents/outline on the left — it had been sitting on the left in both readers despite
  the code's own comment claiming otherwise.
- **Hamburger menu and status bar now match the rest of the suite**: a hand-built popover
  (Open, Theme, About) instead of a plain menu, and the usual bottom-right `v{VERSION}`
  button that opens the changelog.

## [0.1.0] "Quiet Spine" — 2026-09-15

First cut of Pereplyot as a standalone app: `fond-read-gtk` (the shared GTK4/libadwaita
PDF/EPUB reader already used by Kartoteka and Sputnik) extracted into its own repository,
wrapped in a small launcher — Open, drag-and-drop, a System/Light/Dark theme toggle, and an
in-app changelog viewer. Annotations and reading progress are stored per document under
`~/.local/share/pereplyot/`, keyed by content hash, so a document's sidecar stays portable
between Pereplyot and the two embedding apps.

Extracted from `github.com/calstfrancis/kartoteka` — see that repo's
`docs/READER-EXTRACTION.md` for the boundary survey the crate itself came from.

**Reader (`fond-read-gtk`, shared with Kartoteka and Sputnik once they bump their pin):**
- PDF: zoom-to-fit-width and zoom-to-fit-page, next to the existing zoom in/out.
- PDF and EPUB: keyboard page/chapter navigation — Left/Right (and, for PDF, Page Up/Page
  Down, Home/End).
- PDF: zoom changes (in/out/fit) are now debounced (~150ms), and no longer eagerly
  re-render the entire document's continuous-scroll view when continuous mode isn't the
  visible one — that rebuild is deferred until the next time it's actually switched to.

**App:** replaced the single "Recent" list with two shelves — **Library** (a cover-grid of
documents you've intentionally added; PDFs get a real page-1 thumbnail, EPUBs a placeholder
icon for now — see the code's own note on why) and **History** (every document ever opened,
auto-populated as before, now with an "Add to Library" action per row).
