# publish-flatpak-local.sh — manual fallback for building and publishing Pereplyot locally
#
# As of release-flatpak.yml, publish-flatpak.sh just pushes and lets CI do this same
# sequence — this script is what CI actually runs, kept here as a fallback for when CI is
# down or you need to debug the build locally. Requires your own GPG key and a local
# flatpak-builder/runtime setup.
#
# Usage:
#   ./publish-flatpak-local.sh 0.1.0
#
# What this script does NOT do (Claude's job, done before running this):
#   - Write the CHANGELOG entry / metainfo release note
#   - Bump the version / commit / tag
#
# What this script DOES do:
#   1. Verify the version you pass matches pereplyot-ui-gtk/Cargo.toml
#   2. Push this repo to GitHub (flatpak-builder pulls sources from there)
#   3. Build the flatpak
#   4. Pull/clone the public flatpak repo
#   5. Export the build into it
#   6. Regenerate the OSTree summary
#   7. Commit and push the flatpak repo
#
# Prerequisite: packaging/cargo-sources.json must be current.

# `git add -A` below stages ANY difference on disk, including a file that went
# missing for reasons unrelated to this publish (an interrupted checkout, the
# shared /tmp/flatpak-checkout getting cleared, etc.) — it would otherwise get
# silently committed as if the deletion were intentional. This is exactly how
# Zerkalo's own `.Debug` extension ref ended up with a missing object for
# months before anyone noticed (found 2026-09-17).
#
# A whole-repo `ostree fsck` is the wrong tool for this: it has no way to scope
# to just this app's ref, and the shared repo already carries that same
# pre-existing Zerkalo `.Debug` breakage (confirmed 2026-09-22: an orphaned
# ref pointing at a `.dirtree` object deleted from the repo since around
# Zerkalo 0.13.9, unrelated to any app's publish) — so a blanket fsck refuses
# to publish anything, forever, until someone fixes Zerkalo separately.
# Instead: verify this app's own freshly-exported commit is actually
# traversable, and refuse to publish if `git add -A` is about to stage any
# object *deletion* — objects are content-addressed and append-only, so a
# normal publish should never remove one; a deletion showing up here is
# exactly the failure mode above.
