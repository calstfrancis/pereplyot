//! GTK4/libadwaita PDF and EPUB readers, shared across the Fond suite.
//!
//! Rendering, text extraction, search and the annotation schema come from `fond-doc` and
//! `fond-bib`; this crate is the widget layer over them — paged and continuous PDF views,
//! drag-to-annotate, EPUB chapter navigation, undo/redo, and the annotations dialog.
//!
//! The crate knows nothing about how the embedding application identifies a document.
//! Everything it needs comes through [`ReaderHost`]: Kartoteka's implementation resolves a
//! citation key against an open library, and Sputnik's routes a library reading and a local
//! course material to two different places behind the same methods. Nothing here may learn
//! what a citation key is — it is handed a blob path and a host, and that is all it knows.
//!
//! Extracted from Kartoteka's `app_window.rs`; see that repo's `docs/READER-EXTRACTION.md`
//! for the boundary survey this shape came from.
